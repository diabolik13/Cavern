2D Displacement FEM

Hydrogen Storage in salt caverns (2D FEM modelling)
This project concerns a TU Delft master thesis about the constitutive modelling of rock salt for energy (hydrogen) storage purposes.
Within the project the main aim is to solve the stress-strain relationship for rock salt under non linear conditions. 
To obtain the solution we make use of 2D FEM modelling.
